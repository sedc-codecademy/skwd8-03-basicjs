# Class 11 Exercises

## Task 1:  FizzBuzz

Create a function that will take a number as parameter and print in console all the numbers to that number.
* number divisible by 3 print Fizz
* number divisible by 5 print Buzz
* number divisible by 3 and divisible by 5 print FizzBuzz

## Task 2: Number Checker
#### Part 1
Write a function that will give stats about an integer number.
```sh
function getNumberStats(number){
    // your code here
}
```
The function should return an object with the stats as properties. The stats required are:

* Whats the value of the number (value property)
* How many digits the number has (numDigits property)
*  Is the number odd or even (isEven property)
* Is the number positive (isPositive property)
#### Part 2
Write user interface for the number checker.
It should include an entry field for the number as well as a button to trigger the calculation. After the calculation, and appropriate response should be shown on the page.

I.e. if the user enters the number 25, the response should be
```sh
The number 25 is a 2 digit number, it's odd and it's a positive number.
```

## Task 3: DOM Exercise
1. Add one title (h1 element)
2. Add an input field with a button, where text input can be added. When the user clicks on the button, the title is changed with the input;
3. Add three buttons: 'Small', 'Normal', 'Large'. By clicking each button, the font-size of the title should change to three fixed values (ex. 20px, 30px, 40px);
4. Add four elements (div), with the following colours: green, blue, yellow, red. When a user clicks on the element, the title background colour changes appropriately. The default background color for the title is gray.
* Note: Validations are not required, but it would be nice to have if there is time. Styling of elements is not necessary, focus on functionality
